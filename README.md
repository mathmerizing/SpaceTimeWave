# Space-Time Finite Element Method for wave equation
Solving the wave equation as a first-order system in time using space-time finite elements.

## Problem statement
The strong form of the wave equation is given by

$$
\partial_{tt} u - \partial_{xx} u = f \qquad \forall x \in \Omega, t \in [0,T].
$$

As a firs-order system in time this reads

$$
\partial_t v - \partial_{xx} u = f,
$$

$$
\partial_t u = v.
$$

Usually the wave equation is complemented with the initial conditions for $u$ and $v$ which are given as

$$
u(x, 0) = u^0(x),
$$

$$
v(x, 0) = v^0(x).
$$

However, in a recent publication on space-time variatonal material modeling Junker and Wick [[1]](#1) derived that instead one should have an initial and a final condition for the velocity $v$, i.e.
